# Machine Learning Specialization Certificate

This repository contains notebooks and exercise files from my **Machine Learning Specialization** on Coursera, taught by **Andrew Ng**. : https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction

The specialization is a foundational program in machine learning that teaches the core concepts, algorithms, and practical skills for building and evaluating predictive models. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

It consists of **three courses**, and this repository documents the work from the **first two courses** completed so far:

1. **Supervised Machine Learning – Cert**  
   Covers regression, classification, model evaluation, and foundational ML techniques.

2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms – Cert**  
   Extends into deeper models, decision trees, ensemble methods, neural networks, and best practices for model training. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

The specialization content emphasizes both theory and implementation using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
